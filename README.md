This is a simple E-Commerce website landing page made with just html and css and bootstarp I tried to do it as fast as possible and also tried not to make any difference from the given 
example. Except in someplaces I used icons rather than images as it was easily available. And I used one image multiple times because all images weren't present in the gallery which was provided.
Here are some screenshots of the landing page I made.......
